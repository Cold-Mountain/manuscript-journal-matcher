Machine Learning Applications in Cardiovascular Disease Prediction: A Comprehensive Study

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early prediction and intervention crucial for patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms for predicting cardiovascular events using electronic health records from 50,000 patients. We implemented and compared multiple approaches including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and deep neural networks. Our novel ensemble method achieved 94.2% accuracy, 92.8% sensitivity, and 95.6% specificity in predicting cardiovascular events within a 5-year timeframe. The model identified key risk factors including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors. Feature importance analysis revealed that blood pressure variability and HbA1c levels were the strongest predictors. Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in clinical decision support systems for cardiovascular risk assessment.

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year according to the World Health Organization. Early identification of high-risk patients is essential for preventive interventions that can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

2. Methods
We analyzed electronic health records from a large healthcare system spanning 2010-2020. Patient data included demographic information, vital signs, laboratory results, medication history, and clinical outcomes. Machine learning models were trained on 80% of the data and validated on the remaining 20%.

3. Results
Our ensemble model outperformed individual algorithms across all metrics. The area under the ROC curve was 0.962, indicating excellent discriminative ability. Model interpretability analysis showed that systolic blood pressure, age, and diabetes status were the most influential features.

4. Discussion
These results suggest that machine learning can effectively identify patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, enabling targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies.

5. Conclusion
Machine learning represents a promising approach for cardiovascular risk prediction in clinical practice, with potential to improve patient outcomes through early identification and intervention.
