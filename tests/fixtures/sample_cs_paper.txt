Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation with Enhanced Context Modeling

Abstract: Neural machine translation has achieved remarkable success in recent years, but challenges remain in handling long sequences and maintaining contextual coherence. This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism that incorporates hierarchical context modeling to improve translation quality for complex documents. Our approach extends the standard transformer architecture with multi-scale attention layers that capture both local and global dependencies. We evaluate our method on multiple language pairs including English-German, English-French, and English-Chinese translation tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline models, with BLEU score increases of 2.3 points on average. The proposed architecture demonstrates particular effectiveness in translating technical documents and literary texts where contextual understanding is critical. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component in our hierarchical attention mechanism.

1. Introduction
Machine translation has evolved from rule-based systems to statistical methods and now to neural approaches. While neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved state-of-the-art performance, handling long-range dependencies and maintaining coherence across lengthy documents remains challenging.

2. Related Work
Previous work in attention mechanisms includes the original attention-based encoder-decoder models, self-attention in transformers, and various extensions for capturing long-range dependencies. Our work builds upon these foundations while introducing novel hierarchical structures.

3. Methodology
Our proposed architecture consists of three main components: (1) a standard transformer encoder-decoder base, (2) hierarchical attention layers that operate at multiple scales, and (3) a context integration module that combines local and global information.

4. Experiments
We conducted extensive experiments on WMT translation benchmarks. Training was performed on 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs for 100 epochs using Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.

5. Results
Our method achieves consistent improvements across all tested language pairs. The hierarchical attention mechanism proves particularly effective for longer sequences, with performance gains increasing with document length.

6. Conclusion
The proposed hierarchical attention mechanism offers a promising direction for improving neural machine translation, especially for complex documents requiring sophisticated contextual understanding.
